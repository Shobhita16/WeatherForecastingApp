# WeatherForecastingApp
Technologies Used: Java, Android Studio, OpenWeather API

# Developed a responsive Android weather forecasting app that fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API. The app allows users to search for weather conditions in any city and provides the following key features:

# Displays current temperature, feels-like temperature, maximum/minimum temperatures, and atmospheric pressure.
# Dynamically changes background images and weather icons based on current weather conditions (e.g., clear, rain, clouds, snow).
# Integrated asynchronous network calls (AsyncTask) for efficient data retrieval and smooth user experience.
# Implemented clean, intuitive UI with custom backgrounds and weather icons for improved user engagement.
